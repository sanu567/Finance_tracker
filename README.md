A fully functional, user‑friendly finance tracking web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It enables users to track their income and expenses in real time, gain insights into their spending habits, and make better budgeting decisions.

🎯 Key Features

User Authentication & Security – Secure sign‐up and login via JSON Web Tokens (JWT), with password hashing (bcrypt) on the backend.

Transaction Management – Add income or expense entries, edit or delete them as needed.

Categorisation & Filtering – Tag transactions with custom categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Salary) and filter/view by date range or category to drill down into your finances.

Dashboard & Visual Insights – View a summary of your financial health (total income vs expenses), and visualize trends via charts (pie, line or bar) to quickly spot patterns.

Persistent Data Storage – All data stored in MongoDB via Mongoose; ensures your transaction history remains safe and retrievable.

Responsive UI – Built with React (and optionally a UI framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind) so that the app works seamlessly on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

Deployed & Live – The frontend is hosted live (rendered at the link above), signifying it’s production‑ready and accessible from anywhere.
